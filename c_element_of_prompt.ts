Introduction
SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is  used to communicate with databases, allowing us  
to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from  a database. It uses simple English-like commands,  
making it easy to learn and use. It's also  widely used in many applications, from websites  
to mobile apps. In this video, I’ll give you a  beginner-level understanding of SQL which will  
help you handle and manage data efficiently. So,  let's get started! Firstly, we need to understand  
What is DBMS
what is a Database Management System (or DBMS):  Well, fundamentally, it is a software that enables  
users to interact with databases. It provides an  interface to define, create, and manage databases.  
Popular DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle,  SQL Server, and SQLite, etc. a specific type of  
database managed by DBMS is a Relational Database,  which organizes data into tables with rows and  
columns. Here, each table represents an entity,  and each row represents a record or an instance  
of that entity. Similarly, columns contain  attributes or properties of that entity.  
SQL Queries
There’s something called as CRUD  Operations which stand for Create, Read,  
Update, and Delete, and are the fundamental  operations for managing data in a database.  
Create is used to insert new records into a  table, Read is used to retrieve data from a table,  
Update is used to modify existing records, and  Delete is used to remove records from a table.  
Further, to interact with any database,  we use something called as SQL Queries…  
we can define SQL queries as commands or  instructions you give to a database to ask for,  
add, modify, or delete information. In essence,  the basic SQL commands are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,  
DELETE, and JOIN. These queries allow us to  retrieve, add, modify, or delete data from the  
database. Let's understand these basic commands  one by one, starting with SELECT Statement:  
SQL Statements
It is used to retrieve data from the database.  It allows you to specify the columns you want  
to retrieve and the conditions for filtering  the data using the WHERE clause. The syntax  
for the same is, Here, this “condition”  in WHERE clause is used as a filter that  
specifies which rows from a table should be  included in the query's result. This way,  
it allows you to narrow down the data and retrieve  only the records that meet certain criteria.  
And do note that in most SQL database management  systems, each SQL statement or command ends with  
a semicolon (;) Next is INSERT Statement:  It is used to add new records to a table,  
wherein, we specify the values for each column  in the new row. The syntax for the same is  
Next, UPDATE Statement: which is used to modify  existing records in a table. It allows us to  
change the values of specific columns based on  certain conditions. The syntax for the same is,  
Next, DELETE Statement which is used to  remove records from a table based on specified  
conditions. The syntax for the same is, And  lastly, the JOIN statement is used to combine rows  
from two or more tables based on a related column  between them. There are different types of JOINs,  
including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN,  and FULL JOIN, but the basic syntax for the most  
common JOINs is as follows: In the JOIN syntax,  table1 and table2 are the names of the tables  
you want to join, and column_name is the common  column between these tables on which the join is  
based. By using JOINs, you can efficiently combine  data from different tables to extract meaningful  
information from a relational database. Next,  lets continue on SQL concepts, starting with,  
Data Types: Well, in SQL, each column in a  table has a data type that defines the type  
Data Types
of data it can store. Common data types include  INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, and BOOLEAN, among others.  
Similar to them, we have Constraints, which  are rules defined on tables to maintain data  
integrity. Common constraints are PRIMARY KEY  (ensures the uniqueness of a column's values),  
FOREIGN KEY (maintains referential  integrity between two tables),  
NOT NULL (ensures a column must have a value),  and UNIQUE (ensures unique values in a column).  
If you want to understand all types of keys  in a DBMS, you can refer to this video.  
Next, we have Indexes, that are database objects  used to speed up data retrieval. They allow the  
database system to find and access data more  quickly, especially for large tables. And as  
you must already know, speed in everything when  it comes to database management… as any database  
needs to perform a certain set of functions, most  common ones are aggregate functions like SUM, AVG,  
COUNT, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations  on sets of data, returning a single result.  
Here, a GROUP BY clause is usually used in  conjunction with aggregate functions to group  
Group By
data based on specific columns. It is typically  used in combination with functions like SUM or  
COUNT to get summary results. Here’s a  sample syntax for your understanding,  
Here, SELECT: Specifies the columns to be  retrieved in the result. column1: is the column  
you want to group by. This can be any column in  the table. SUM(column2): The aggregate function  
SUM calculates the total of values in column2 for  each group. table_name: The name of the table you  
are querying. One thing you should remember  is that when you use the GROUP BY clause, the  
SELECT statement should include either the columns  used for grouping or the aggregate functions used  
to calculate values within each group. Next,  there’s another clause called ORDER BY which  
AutoBuy
is used to sort the result set in ascending or  descending order based on one or more columns.  
And when combined with an aggregate function like  COUNT(), it allows us to sort the result based on  
the count of occurrences of a specific value  or the number of rows returned for each group.  
Here’s an example syntax, Here, SELECT: Specifies  the columns you want to retrieve from the table,  
including the column you want to count occurrences  of. COUNT(column_name): counts the occurrences of  
the specified column values. You can also use  COUNT(*) to count the total number of rows in  
each group. AS count_alias: is somewhat  of an optional part. It allows you to  
provide an alias (a.k.a a custom name) for the  count result, making the output more readable.  
FROM table_name: Specifies the name of the table  from which you are retrieving the data from.  
GROUP BY column_name: again, groups the result set  by the specified column, so the COUNT() function  
calculates the count for each group separately.  And lastly, ORDER BY count_alias [ASC | DESC]:  
This part sorts the result set based on the  count value. You can use either ASC (ascending)  
or DESC (descending) to specify the sorting  order. Next, there’s the concept of a subquery,  
SubQuery
which is also known as an inner query or nested  query. Fundamentally, by definition, it is a query  
that is embedded within another query. It is used  to retrieve data that will be used as a filter or  
condition in the main query. More on this in  a separate video, but here’s a sample syntax,  
The main advantage of using a subquery is that  it allows us to perform complex filtering and  
data retrieval in a more organized and efficient  manner. Next, we have Views, which are virtual  
tables created by queries and can be used like  regular tables. They provide a way to simplify  
complex queries and restrict access to sensitive  data. Here’s the sample syntax of a View,  
Transactions
Next, we have Transactions, that are nothing but  sequences of one or more SQL operations treated  
as a single unit. The purpose of a transaction  is to ensure that a series of related database  
operations either all succeed or all fail. This  is equally important as it helps in maintaining  
data integrity and consistency in SQL. This  property of transactions is often referred  
to as the ACID properties, which stands for  Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.  
Furthermore, transactions have a significant  impact on the reliability and correctness  
of database operations as well. Here’s a  sample syntax of a transaction in SQL, Next,  
we have the concept of Normalization, which is  fundamentally the process of organizing data in a  
database to eliminate redundancy and improve data  integrity. It involves dividing a database into  
tables and defining relationships between them. We  have another thing in SQL called Stored Procedures  
Triggers
which are primarily precompiled SQL code that can  be stored and executed on the database server.  
They also help in improving performance and  security. Lastly, we have the concept of Triggers,  
which are database objects that automatically  execute in response to specific events,  
such as data modification, thereby, ensuring data  consistency and integrity. Here’s the syntax for  
the same, CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER: This is  the beginning of the trigger creation statement.  
The OR REPLACE keyword is optional and allows  us to modify an existing trigger with the same  
name. trigger_name: is the name we give to the  trigger. {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF}: specifies  
when the trigger will be activated concerning the  triggering event. BEFORE triggers are executed  
before the triggering event, AFTER triggers are  executed after the triggering event, and INSTEAD  
OF triggers are executed instead of the triggering  event (used in certain cases like with views).  
{INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}: This specifies the  type of action that will activate the trigger.  
[FOR EACH ROW]: is the clause used when you want  the trigger to be fired for each affected row  
in the table. It is usually used in row-level  triggers and, BEGIN ... END; is the body of the  
trigger where you write the SQL statements that  should be executed when the trigger is activated.
